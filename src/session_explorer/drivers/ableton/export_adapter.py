"""Adapter for optional Ableton-compatible project export.

Design intent (Pathway B in the research framing): if a public Ableton Live
Set export library is importable in this environment, use it to produce a
minimal Live Set / project structure. Otherwise fall back to a transparent
mock export — a folder of JSON plus an explicit limitations note — so the
research pipeline never depends on proprietary tooling being present.

Notes on the current tooling landscape (July 2026):

* Ableton's public developer offering for Live 12.3 is the **Extensions SDK**,
  a TypeScript/JavaScript SDK for building extensions that run inside Live.
  It is not a Python library and does not provide offline Live Set authoring.
* No official Ableton Live Set export package is published on PyPI.
* This adapter therefore probes a small list of candidate module names and,
  when none is available, performs a mock export. We deliberately do NOT
  hand-craft ``.als`` gzip/XML files: that format is proprietary and
  unversioned from our perspective, and fabricating one would overstate
  compatibility.

# Export limitations

This folder was produced by **Ableton Session State Explorer v0** operating in
**research graph mode** (mock export).

## Why is this not an Ableton Live Set?

No public Ableton Live Set export library was available in this Python
environment. Ableton's current public developer tooling (the Extensions SDK)
targets extensions running *inside* Live and does not provide offline Live
Set authoring from Python. Rather than fabricate a `.als` file — a proprietary
format we cannot guarantee compatibility with — this prototype exports its
full session representation as transparent JSON.

## What is in this folder

- `project_state.json` — the complete Ableton-style session state
  (tracks, clips, scenes, devices, sends, returns, master) in this
  prototype's documented schema.
- `session_graph.json` — the same session as a typed node/edge graph.

## What was omitted

- A binary `.als` Live Set file (no supported export path available).
- Device presets, automation curves, and audio media (out of scope for v0).

If a supported export library becomes available, the adapter in
`ableton_export_adapter.py` will use it automatically.
