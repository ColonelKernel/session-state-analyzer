"""Learned DAW-state prediction — a deliberately small proof-of-concept.

This module demonstrates the *prediction* half of the research framing:
given partial session state, predict withheld DAW state. The task here is
masked device-family prediction: given a track's role, type, and the rest of
its device chain, predict the family of a held-out device.

Scope, stated honestly:

* The model is trained on a **synthetic corpus** of sessions generated from
  seeded, role-conditioned device-chain priors — not on real productions.
  It is a benchmark harness and interpretability baseline, not a claim about
  real-world mixing practice.
* The model is a hand-rolled conditional-probability baseline (role- and
  track-type-conditioned family frequencies with pairwise co-occurrence
  lift). It is interpretable by construction: every score decomposes into
  named counts.
